# Pizza-Sale-SQL-Project

Hello guys, 

I made a new project based on pizza sales in SQL. This project involves analyzing pizza sales data to extract valuable insights about order quantities, revenue generation, and customer preferences. By utilizing SQL queries, the analysis focuses on determining the total orders placed, calculating total revenue, identifying popular pizza types and sizes, and understanding order patterns over time. The project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of pizza sales performance and trends, aiding in strategic decision-making for business improvement.
